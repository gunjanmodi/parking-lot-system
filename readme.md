# Parking Lot System - Low-Level System Design

## Overview

This Python project implements a simple Parking Lot System using low-level coding practices. The project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, ensuring reliability and maintainability through a comprehensive set of unit tests by following SOLID priciples.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Parking Lot System on your machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gunjanmodi/parking-lot-system.git
   cd parking-lot-system
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This command will discover and run all the tests in the `tests` directory.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to enhance readability and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key directories:

- **`src/`**: Contains the source code for the Parking Lot System.
  - `parking_lot_system.py`: Main application logic.
  - Other relevant modules.

- **`tests/`**: Houses all the unit tests for the Parking Lot System.
  - `test_parking_lot_system.py`: Unit tests for the Parking Lot System.
  - Other test modules as needed.
